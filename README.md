# Plancklens2018
Planck 2018 CMB lensing pipeline

### Missing bits at the present time:

* Response and semi-analytical N0 noise biases calculation  (soon), together with some explanatory document, because these calculations on the curved-sky are a nightmare.
* cg-gradient filtering libraries
* libaml apodize and cut_sky_cl
* N1 file cleaning and readability
* sims module for Planck dx12 (and custom sims ?)
* Parameter files and example scripts
